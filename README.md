## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

We've already run this for you in the `Codespaces: server` terminal window below. If you need to stop the server for any reason you can just run `npm start` again to bring it back online.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the built-in Simple Browser (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P > Simple Browser: Show`) to view your running application.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
